 * C Practice
 * This assignment is to help you practice using C. Is is setup to
 * a set of various functions that tests the ideas you are learning.
 * 
 * In addition to this file, you will need to create a test file, that tests
 * every function!
 * 
 * This is called a 'header' library, meaning it is a collection of functions
 * that can be used in other files. This is the standard way of creating
 * libraries in C. In this case, the functions are implemented in the header file (.h)
 * but sometimes they are separated between header declarations (.h) and source files (.c)
 * which  you will explore in other assignments.

 * Creates an array based on the fibonacci sequence.
 * The size is the number of elements in the array.
 *
 * For example, if size is 5, then the array should be [1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
 * if the size is 1, then the array should be [1]
 * if the size is <= 0, then NULL should be returned.
 *
 * As a reminder, the fibonacci sequence is:
 * is the value of the two previous values added together.
 *
 * So the first two values [0], [1] are 1, 1.
 * The third value is 1 + 1 = 2
 * The fourth value is 1 + 2 = 3
 * The fifth value is 2 + 3 = 5
 *
 * This means, you can set the first two values of the array to 1, 1,
 * and then start your loop forward.

/**
 * Copies elements of an array from start to end (inclusive) into a new array.
 *
 * Returns the new array. However, if end is less than start, it loops around copying
 * elements from the beginning of the array.. (thus picture your array as a circle).
 *
 * if start or end are invalid (less than 0, or greater than or equal to size), then
 * return NULL.
 *
 * Example: assume an array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 * if make start = 1, and end = 3, then the new array should be [2, 3, 4]
 * if make start = 3, and end = 1, then the new array should be [4, 5, 1, 2]
 *
 * Notice, new_size is a pointer, so you can set the size of the new array in your function. This
 * is commonly done in C, as a way to have multiple return values. (both the return, and the modified parameter)
 *
 * In the two examples above, new_size would be set to 3, and then 4 respectively.
 *
 * You will want to remember pointer arithmetic here. You can't say something like new_size = steps (where steps
 * is your new calculated size based on start to end), instead you have to say *new_size = steps+1)
 *
 * Make sure to test this function, this is probably the hardest of the batch, and easy
 * to get an OB1 error!
